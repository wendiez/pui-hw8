   ## website

   <https://wendiez.github.io/ux-motion-principles/>

   ## part 1

   ### i. What is the purpose of your website?

   A tool website about the UX principles for motion design that helps the user learn and pick the best solution according to their UX cases.

   ### ii. What information do you convey with your website?

   How motion can convey different UX with visual qualities adjustment.

   ### iii. How is it interesting and engaging?

   This is a tool that helps the user find the best solution for motion and try out different types of motion. Often, we do not have a real sense of our motion until we render it in the final UI, which makes it harder for designers to make design decisions earlier. User can adjust with the control bar and see the effects in real-time, they can also copy the source code and use it for their own projects.

   ### iv. Who is the target audience?

   The target users are interaction student or professional designers. For students, they can learn the UX principles for motion design. For professional designers, they can use it as a toolkit to work on.

   ## part 2

   - pick from templates the UX motion they want to see.

   - adjust with the control bar and see the available effects(different for each type of motion examples):

   - - speed (s)
     - fade (s,scale)
     - curvature(sin,cosin)
     - delays(s)
     - sizes (1x,1.5x,2x)

   - can change color for the examples.

   - scroll down to see the next example

   - export/copy the attributions for further use

   - Click on the navigation bar to go back to the main page.

   ## part 3

   i. Name of the tool

   1. [popmotion](<https://popmotion.io/>)
   2. [bootstrap](<https://getbootstrap.com/>)
   3. [animate.css](<https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/>)

   ii. Why you chose to use it?

   In order to implement motion that can be manipulated with simple variables. [popmotion](<https://popmotion.io/>)supports a lightweight motion to support common UX rationales.

   iii. How you used it?

   Use popmotion together with CSS. [animate.css](<https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/>)for general functions like buttons, navigation. Popmotion for the motion examples and the write js functions to let users control and see changes.

   iv. What it adds to your website?

   fun and engaging animation that runs smoothly and can be understand by beginner codes such as a designer.

   ## part 4

   - changed the design layout from fixed to scroll-enable.
   - use dot to navigate examples within the same page (was previously different pages)
   - add more attributions to the motion (speed,fade,curvature,delays,sizes)
   - can change color for the examples

   ##part 5 - challenges

   1. Ways to minimize errors with proper structure - My website initially has a lot of errors and bugs. This was due to not structuring my design components well. things were not grouped. So when the code runs, a lot of stuff is floating around
   2. Getting stuck right from the beginning with CSS grid systems when using bootstraps.
   3. Hard to locate the scripts. As a novice code learner, my code looks messy and often times there are problems that resulted from not properly styling my code.
